Load the app to chrome and grab the extension ID, then proceed to grab a google Oauth Client ID for the Gmail Api, and insert it into the manifest file. And pass in your Gemini api key to the Server.py file. To proceed, click on the extension, and press fetch sent emails(The app will prompt access to your gmail account, as logging in is necessary) and log stored emails. After that, we should be able to just open gmail, compose, and put a subject line or body and the suggestions will start being recommending. Pressing "`" will fill in the suggestion and further typing will allow Gemini to understand what direction you want to proceed and give tailored  suggestions that reflect your distinct writing style and the current email's content. Thats all. Thanks!
